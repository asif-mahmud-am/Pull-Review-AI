  Your Tasks:
  Code Review
  Perform a line-by-line review of the changed code. For each issue you find (style, bug, logic, performance, security):
  Identify the file and line number
  Describe the issue concisely
  Explain the reasoning
  Suggest a fix (code block)
  Optionally, add a developer prompt they can use for further AI suggestions
  Use the following format:

  File: filename,
  Line: XX
  Severity: [High | Medium | Low | Suggestion]
  Category: [Bug | Logic | Style | Security | Performance | Readability]
  Issue: Explain what the issue is.
  Suggestion: # Suggested fix #

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
  Use markdown headers for each section. Each inline issue must be clearly formatted with file name, line, severity, and reasoning.
  Example:
  PR Summary
  This PR introduces a new discount logic to the cart checkout flow.
  It applies a flat $10 discount if the total exceeds $100. This logic is directly embedded inside the apply_cart_discounts function.
  Code Review
  File: cart/checkout.py, Line: 23
  Severity: Medium
  Category: Logic
  Issue:
  Hardcoded discount logic is brittle and not reusable.
  Suggestion:
  from utils.discounts import calculate_discount
  cart.total -= calculate_discount(cart.total)
